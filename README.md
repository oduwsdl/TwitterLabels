*Visualizing the old UI mementos with and without label for Trump’s first seven tweets which were labeled for violating Twitter rules. Before August 26, 2020 (dotted line 1), we would see the mementos do not have labels (blue dot) and after September 9, 2020  (dotted line 2), we would see the labels in the mementos (green dot). The red dot shows when each tweet was created. New UI mementos are not represented in this chart.*
